CODSOFT – C++ Internship

Week 1 – Task 2
Task: SIMPLE CALCULATOR
Goal: Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int a,b;
	char ch;
	cout<<"Enter the input two number:";
	cin>>a>>b;
	cout<<"\n choose the operation to perform('+','-','*','/'):";
	cin>>ch;
	if(ch=='+')
	{
	    cout<<a+b;
	}
	else if(ch=='-')
	{
	    cout<<a-b;
	}
	else if(ch=='*')
	{
	    cout<<a*b;
	}
	else if(ch=='/')
	{
	    cout<<a/b;
	}
	else
	{
	    cout<<"Invalid";
	}
}
